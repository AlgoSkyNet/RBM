# Restricted Boltzmann Machine 

The original purpose of this project was to create a working implementation of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). However, after creating a working RBM function my interest moved to the classification RBM. After creating the classification RBM I got interested in stacking RBM's and Deep Belief Networks (DBN). As the project kept expanding I decided to turn my work into a package. This Readme functions serves as a description of my package and a small introduction to RBM's, classification RBM's, stacked RBM's and DBN's.
