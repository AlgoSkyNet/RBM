Description: This is a package for training Restricted Boltzman machines, stacked Reststricted Boltzmann Machines and 
  Deep Belief Networks on binary data. All models can be trained in a supervised manner and the package includes predict functions
  to get model predictions on an unseen test-set. The package also includes the ReconstructRBM function that can be used to 
  reconstruct images with either a RBM model or a stacked RBM model (unsupervised).
